## About Me

Hello, I am Camden Heafitz from Marblehead, MA, a rising senior at Amherst College. I am double majoring in statistics and psychology and one of the captains of the Menâ€™s Track and Field team. In my spare time, I am writing a psychology honors thesis about the effects of stress and caffeine on performance and persistence. In addition, I practice guitar, piano and vocals in a band on campus. My true interests lie in data science, sports, and music. 

Welcome to my portfolio compiling my final projects in previous Statistics and Data Science courses at Amherst College. I am most passionate about my Track and Field project where I analyzed over 10 years worth of collegiate track and field data to give an interesting perspective on my conference's history.
