I analyzed the last 14 years of the Division III New England Region Track and Field Championships, Amherst’s Indoor championship meet. Below is my shiny app interface. See which events have been dominated by which schools, and how significant the margins of improvement are from year to year."

    "text": "This was my final project in a statistics course from Spring 2022. My report analyzed an old register for the Parsons Paper Company of Holyoke, Ma in the 1860s. The register was found in an attic in Holyoke and brought to the attention of my professor, who then tasked my class with curating a report that analyzes the register in an interesting way. I spent countless hours transcribing the names on each page to form a database that I could then use R to make inferences on. My final report is below."

In addition, I practice guitar, piano and vocals in a band on campus. My true interests lie in data science, sports, and music.\nWelcome to my portfolio compiling my final projects in previous Statistics and Data Science courses at Amherst College. I am most passionate about my Track and Field project where I analyzed over 10 years worth of collegiate track and field data to give an interesting perspective on my conference’s history."
